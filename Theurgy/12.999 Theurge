/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-

	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.

	To add your own content to the Character Sheet, use the syntax below and save it in a file. You can then import this file directly to the sheet using the "Import" button and "Import/Export" bookmark.

	There you can either import the file as a whole or just copy the text into a dialogue.



	-KEEP IN MIND-

	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, either by importing consecutive files or pasting the scripts into the dialogue.

	It is recommended to enter the code in a freshly downloaded or reset sheet before adding any other information so that there won't be any conflicts.
